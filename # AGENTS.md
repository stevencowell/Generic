# AGENTS.md
## Reference Materials
The following files demonstrate the preferred structure and style for new
project pages. The assistant should consult them for guidance whenever
generating or reviewing code:

- `best-practices/clock-example.html` â€“ a copy of your clock project page
- Any related CSS or scripts in `best-practices/` (if added)

## Usage
1. Open the example HTML page(s) to see typical layout and formatting.
2. Follow the same section order, header styles, and basic CSS when
   producing new pages.
3. Keep comments and indentation consistent with the examples.

The assistant must reference these files first whenever asked to create or
evaluate project pages in this repository.
